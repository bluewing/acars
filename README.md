_ACARS_ is a simple but opinionated GitHub Action designed for reporting CI/CD failures to Slackâ€”for example, if PHPUnit tests fail on a commit. It is named after the [Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACARS), of the same acronym. It is written in Rust, and when used as a GitHub action, runs inside of an [Alpine Linux-derived Rust container](https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust/blob/186e4d580b5581861907c015d6b58919c809e375/1.61.0/alpine3.14/Dockerfile).
