_ACARS_ is a simple but opinionated GitHub Action designed for reporting CI/CD failures to Slackâ€”for example, if PHPUnit tests fail on a commit. It is named after the [Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACARS), of the same acronym. It is written in Rust and runs inside a linux docker container.
